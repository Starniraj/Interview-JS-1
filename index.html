<!-- 1 . Differnece between == and === operator -->

<!-- ==  : the double equal to compare the between two value and triple equal to also compare the value but also check the datatypes.--> 

<!-- 2. What is spread operator. 
   
    Spread operator denotes with ... and it copy the array or object into another array of object.
    
    let my arr = ["h","i"]

    ...my arr "h","i"
-->

<!-- 3. Difference between var and let const.
          It support hoisting and you can take two or more variable same type in var.
          but in let and const we can't do same thing as well as var like not support hoisting and cant't take same variable more than once. 
          Const: it can't be declared without initi
         
-->

<!-- 4. What is Execution context 
  
    In this phase the exact value is assigned and undefined value is removed and after calling the function and the function will execute.
-->

<!-- 5. First Class Function : In this function variable can be treated an another variable and in first class function we also passed a argument tocan be another function 
    can be returned by another function. 
   

    example 

    function add(x, y) {  
    return x + y;  
}  
let sum = add; 
-->

<!--6. Closures   Closure is not something that we create manually or explicitly. It happens automatically in certain situations which be need to recognize.
 Closure makes a function remember all the variables that esisted at the function birthplace initially. 
Any function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which the function was created.

example ; 

   const ticketBooking = function(){
    let passengerCount = 0;

    return function(){
        passengerCount++;
        console.log(`the passenger Count is ${passengerCount}`);

    };
};

const bookie = ticketBooking();
bookie();
bookie();
bookie();
