    <!-- 1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.

        == operator : It will compare two value as equal.
        === operator : It will compare tow value  as equal and also check the datatype.
        
        console.log(2==2)//true
        console.log(2==="2")//false

        2. What is the spread operator?

        Ans : It is denotes with ... . An object expressions to be expanded in places where zero or more key value pairs are expected.

        const number = [1,2,3]

        console.log(...number);

        3. What are the differences between var, let and const?

        Ans : Let and const does not support hoisting but var support hoisting.
              we cannot take same variable more than one using let and const but using var we can take same variable more than one.
              var and let can be decalred without initilization but const cannot be declared without initilization.

        4. What is execution context?

        Ans : The are two phase:
         1.Creation phase : In creation phase the value is undefined and address is located to memory after that when work is done creation phase.
         2.Execution phase : Exact value is assigned to the variable and undefined is removed and function will run when it called.

        5. What is meant by first class functions?

        Ans :  The functions can be passed as values into another functions or can be returned from 
           another functions a values . This unique feature of functions makes them called as first class functions /First
           class citizens.

            let i = function(){
            return function j(){//FCF
            console.log("I am fn J");
         }
       }
           console.log(i());

       6. What are closures?

          Closure is not something that we create manually or explicitly. It happens automatically in certain situations which be need to recognize.
         Closure makes a function remember all the variables that existed at the function birthplace initially. 
         Any function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which the function was created. 

       7.  Give an example of closure

         const ticketBooking = function(){
             pasengercount = 0;

             return function(){
                 pasengercount++
                 console.log(`The passenger count is ${pasenger count}`);
             }
         }

         const bookie = ticketBooking();
         bookie(); //the pasenger count is 1
         bookie(); //the pasenger count is 2
         bookie(); //the pasenger count is 3.

        8. Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.

        Ans : It is used to borrowing the function. 
         
          call :  we can call the method using in normal bracket.
          apply : Using [] big bracket.
          bind : In bind method it return the function it run when it called.
          
          let employee1 = {
              fname : "Niraj",
              lname : "Singh",
              role : "Analyst",
          }

         function showDetails(age,gender){
             console.log(this.fname,this.lname,this.role,age,gender);
         }

         let employee2 = {
              fname : "Pawan",
              lname : "Rao",
              role : "Developer",
         }

         employee1.showDetails.call(employee2);

        showDetails.call(employee1,23,"M");//Niraj, Singh,Analyst, 23, M  output.
        showDetails.apply(employee2 ,[23,"M"]);
        let res1 = showDetails.blind(employee2);
        res1(24,"M);
